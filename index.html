                <p>Hark!!! ye lads of noble stock</p>
                <p> To lore of courage born on rock</p>
                <p> Hark, Oromë!  Hark, Nahar!</p> 
                <p> Praise the tale sung under Star</p>
                <p> A Firstborn of the Kindreds Three</p>
                    The son of tree and branch was he
                    Worn by grief of Olórin slain,
                    He heedless journeys on again
                    Keen of eye and fleet of foot,
                    The Elven prince leaps from his root
                    Forth the Three Hunters!
                    Yo ho!
                
                </p><p>
                    
                    Not the least among Durin’s folk,
                    He tramps his boots o’er rill and rook,
                    Striding twice for every step
                    Of Man and Elf beside him, kept
                    Watch at midnight, awake at dawn,
                    Running, running, o’er hill and lawn,
                    Never tiring, ever forward,
                    Never yielding, ever onward,
                    With iron will and heart of flesh,
                    The Dwarvish lord ne’er stops to rest
                    Forth the Three Hunters!
                    Yo ho!
                
                </p><p>

                    Come! O Wind, to speed their flight,
                    Through endless day, through restless night
                    Come, Elessar!  Come, Andúril!
                    Both Tree and Flower endureth still
                    Now he holds his hand on high,
                    Wielding sword and crying, Fly!</p>
                    With me cross stone and plain
                <p> Our friends to find, our foes to gain!</p> 
                <p> Long foretold, rugged, old,</p> 
                <p> The King of Men came, strong and bold</p> 
                <p> Forth the Three Hunters!</p> 
                <p> Yo ho!</p>
